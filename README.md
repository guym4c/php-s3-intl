# `php-s3-intl`
A library for managing and using internationalised text in a web application, using S3 for storage.

Comes batteries-included, with caching & CDN support, and a Twig extension in the box.

#### What it will look like
* You store JSON `key => value` [FormatJS](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs)-style langpacks on S3.
* You edit these directly, or through an interface you've built using the hooks this package makes available to you.
* You cache the langpacks near or on your app server forever, until flushed.

# Install
via Composer:
```bash
composer require guym4c/php-s3-intl
```
